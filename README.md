# UrlVerse

**UrlVerse** helps you clean up your list of URLs, making it useful for pentesting and bug bounty.

## What It Does

This tool filters out less interesting URLs from your list, helping you focus on what really matters. For instance, if youâ€™re digging through results from tools like Waymore, UrlVerse can give you a fresh start by filtering out the noise.

## Equivalences

The **equivalences** section allows you to define specific words or terms that should be treated as equivalent during processing. This is useful when you want to group different variations of a term together to ensure they are recognized as the same.

### Example

If you're interested in processing URLs related to Tesla vehicles, you might define equivalences like this:

    equivalences := map[string][]string{
    "TESLA": {"model-3", "model-y", "model-s", "model-x"},
        }
## Key Features

- **Excludes boring URLs**: UrlVerse prints one URL per feature of a website while blocking known dull URLs.
- **Customizable filters**: Easily add your own paths and extensions to the exclusion list.
- **Smart detection**: It can  recognize patterns in URLs, ignoring things like:
  - Directories such as `/docs`
  - Files with extensions like `.png`
  - Profile pages
  - Certain query parameters

## What It Ignores

UrlVerse is designed to filter out:
- **Boring directories**: e.g., `/docs`, `/support`
- **Uninteresting file types**: e.g., `.css`, `.jpg`
- **Profile and blog pages**: e.g., `/user/FooBar`
- **Certain URL parameters**: e.g., UTM parameters
